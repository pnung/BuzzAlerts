5. **Update the Config File**  
   Open the `config.py` file in the project directory and update the following content:
   ```python
   SENDER_EMAIL = 'your-email@gmail.com'
   RECEIVER_EMAIL = 'recipient-email@gmail.com'
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
   CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = '/path/to/chromedriver/executable' # Ensure this is the path to the executable file and not the Chrome Driver folder
   CHROME_BINARY_PATH = '/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome' 

   # To find your CHROME_BINARY_PATH:
   # On macOS: Open Finder, navigate to Applications, find Google Chrome, right-click it, select "Show Package Contents", then navigate to Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome.
   # On Windows: Typically, the path will be something like C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe. You can verify this by right-clicking the Chrome shortcut, selecting "Properties", and checking the "Target" field.
   # On Linux: The path is usually /usr/bin/google-chrome or /usr/bin/chromium-browser.
